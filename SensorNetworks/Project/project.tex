	% IEEEtran.cls defaults to using nonbold math in the Abstract.
	% This preserves the distinction between vectors and scalars. However,
	% if the journal you are submitting to favors bold math in the abstract,
	% then you can use LaTeX's standard command \boldmath at the very start
	% of the abstract to achieve this. Many IEEE journals frown on math
	% in the abstract anyway. In particular, the Computer Society does
	% not want either math or citations to appear in the abstract.
	
	% Note that keywords are not normally used for peerreview papers.
	
	% make the title area
	\maketitle
	
	
	% To allow for easy dual compilation without having to reenter the
	% abstract/keywords data, the \IEEEcompsoctitleabstractindextext text will
	% not be used in maketitle, but will appear (i.e., to be "transported")
	% here as \IEEEdisplaynotcompsoctitleabstractindextext when compsoc mode
	% is not selected <OR> if conference mode is selected - because compsoc
	% conference papers position the abstract like regular (non-compsoc)
	% papers do!
	%\IEEEdisplaynotcompsoctitleabstractindextext
	% \IEEEdisplaynotcompsoctitleabstractindextext has no effect when using
	% compsoc under a non-conference mode.
	
	
	% For peer review papers, you can put extra information on the cover

	% For peerreview papers, this IEEEtran command inserts a page break and
	% creates the second title. It will be ignored for other modes.

	\section{Introduction}
	The simulated problem involves a delay-tolerant network (DTN), with two stationary nodes 0 and 2, positioned 10000 m apart, and a mobile node 1, moving between them. The initial position of the nodes are shown in Fig. 1.
	
	
	The propagation loss model is constant range, which means that up to the given maximum distance (200 m initially) the packets are transmitted with the given transmission power (1.5 dBm in this case). Beyond the maximum range, the transmission power drops to -1000 dBm, which is effectively 0\cite{range loss doc}. Note that with Node1 travelling along the $y=3$ line, it means that it needs to be at $x \leq 199.98 \approx 200$ to reach Node0, and at $ x > 9800$ to reach Node2.
