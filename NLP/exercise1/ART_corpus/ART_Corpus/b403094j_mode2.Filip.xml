hybrid cylindrical model for characterization of MCM-41 is proposed in this work, where the heterogeneity of the pore of MCM-41 is taken into account by dividing the interactions between the fluid molecules in the pore and the wall into two parts: (1) the potential energies from the oxygen atoms inside the wall, represented by the complete analytical potential model proposed by our group recently;<REF TYPE="P" ID="cit19">19</REF> (2) the potential energies from the silanol coverage and/or other unknown factors in the surface of the channel of MCM-41, represented by the cylindrical
