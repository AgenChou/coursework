“fuzziness” to the spectrum of vibrations and is a key step in the definition of EVA; a value that is too small will fail to detect similarities where they exist, and one that is too large will result in overlaps that obscure significant proportions of the variation in the descriptor.</text></s> <s sid="38"><CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Mod" conceptID="Mod1" novelty="None" advantage="None"/><text>The

advantage="None"/><text>The choice of increment determines the number of variables in the EVA descriptor; thus, for example, a 2 cm<SP>−1</SP> increment results in a descriptor string of 2000 variables.</text></s> <s sid="42"><CoreSc1 atype="GSC" type="Mod" conceptID="Mod1" novelty="None" advantage="None"/><text>Molecular vibrations are therefore depicted as “peaks” of intensity on a scale
