	% IEEEtran.cls defaults to using nonbold math in the Abstract.
	% This preserves the distinction between vectors and scalars. However,
	% if the journal you are submitting to favors bold math in the abstract,
	% then you can use LaTeX's standard command \boldmath at the very start
	% of the abstract to achieve this. Many IEEE journals frown on math
	% in the abstract anyway. In particular, the Computer Society does
	% not want either math or citations to appear in the abstract.
	
	% Note that keywords are not normally used for peerreview papers.
	
	% make the title area
	\maketitle
	
	
	% To allow for easy dual compilation without having to reenter the
	% abstract/keywords data, the \IEEEcompsoctitleabstractindextext text will
	% not be used in maketitle, but will appear (i.e., to be "transported")
	% here as \IEEEdisplaynotcompsoctitleabstractindextext when compsoc mode
	% is not selected <OR> if conference mode is selected - because compsoc
	% conference papers position the abstract like regular (non-compsoc)
	% papers do!
	%\IEEEdisplaynotcompsoctitleabstractindextext
	% \IEEEdisplaynotcompsoctitleabstractindextext has no effect when using
	% compsoc under a non-conference mode.
	
	
	% For peer review papers, you can put extra information on the cover
	% page as needed:
	% \ifCLASSOPTIONpeerreview
	% \begin{center} \bfseries EDICS Category: 3-BBND \end{center}
	% \fi
	%
	% For peerreview papers, this IEEEtran command inserts a page break and
	% creates the second title. It will be ignored for other modes.

	\subsection{}
	Assuming Player I has a strategy $(\dfrac{1}{2}, \dfrac{1}{2})$, the payoff for Player II if they chose B would be $\dfrac{1}{2} \cdot a + \dfrac{1}{2} \cdot c$, and the payoff if they chose A is 0.
	
	Therefore, for Player II to always prefer A over B, \[\dfrac{1}{2} \cdot a + \dfrac{1}{2} \cdot c < 0\]
	\[\Rightarrow a+c <0\]
	
	\subsection{}
	Let $a,b,c,d = 0$. Then for either player, a strategy $(\lambda, 1-\lambda)$ for any $\lambda \in [0,1]$, the payoff is 0, and there are infinitely many such $\lambda$'s.
