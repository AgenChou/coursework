	% IEEEtran.cls defaults to using nonbold math in the Abstract.
	% This preserves the distinction between vectors and scalars. However,
	% if the journal you are submitting to favors bold math in the abstract,
	% then you can use LaTeX's standard command \boldmath at the very start
	% of the abstract to achieve this. Many IEEE journals frown on math
	% in the abstract anyway. In particular, the Computer Society does
	% not want either math or citations to appear in the abstract.
	
	% Note that keywords are not normally used for peerreview papers.
	
	% make the title area
	\maketitle
	
	
	% To allow for easy dual compilation without having to reenter the
	% abstract/keywords data, the \IEEEcompsoctitleabstractindextext text will
	% not be used in maketitle, but will appear (i.e., to be "transported")
	% here as \IEEEdisplaynotcompsoctitleabstractindextext when compsoc mode
	% is not selected <OR> if conference mode is selected - because compsoc
	% conference papers position the abstract like regular (non-compsoc)
	% papers do!
	%\IEEEdisplaynotcompsoctitleabstractindextext
	% \IEEEdisplaynotcompsoctitleabstractindextext has no effect when using
	% compsoc under a non-conference mode.
	
	
	% For peer review papers, you can put extra information on the cover

	% For peerreview papers, this IEEEtran command inserts a page break and
	% creates the second title. It will be ignored for other modes.

	\subsection{Cross-site scripting}
	Cross-site scripting (XSS) occurs when a user injects a client-side code into a web page, through a field taking user input. This code is then executed in another's client browser (as is the case with DOM-based and reflected attacks) or on the server side (stored attacks). It occurs when the website fails to validate user's input. It is considered to be of high, although not critical severity\cite{xss review}. It is the most common type of website attacks, which has been around since 1990s\cite{xss2}.
	
	The aim of XSS attacks is most often to access a client's usernames and passwords, and other data such as banking information, which is often stored in the browser.
	
	A real-life example of an XSS attack is a malicious script known as "Samy Worm", which in 2005 propagated across MySpace, making over 1 million users execute the payload within just 20 h. The  development of the worm and the details of the implementation were described by the author himself after MySpace has fixed its issues, and is still available online: \url{http://samy.pl/popular/tech.html}.
	
	\subsection{Directory traversal attacks}
	Directory traversal attacks aim to access the parent directory and traverse the directory tree on the server, by providing user input which includes multiple \texttt{../} that traverse back to the root directory. Note that repeating \texttt{../} more times than necessary after reaching the root directory does not have any effect.
	
	It can be used to read or execute files stored on the server. The most common PoC of directory traversal is accessing \texttt{/etc/passwd}, where the passwords are stored on a Unix system.
	
	
	\subsection{SQL code injection}
	SQL code injection - as the name suggests - relies on inserting SQL code devised by the attacker into the server's database. The code may involve for example dropping the tables. It is another example of an attack which can be prevented by sanitizing user input correctly.
	
	Some of the most severe cases of SQL injection attacks involve an American hacker Albert Gonzalez, who in 2005-2007 used this technique on corporate systems to steal and later re-sell over 1.5 million credit card details\cite{Gonzalez}.
	
	
	\subsection{Python code injection}
	This time we are interested in injecting Python script into the website. It is a much less well known attack than for example SQL injection, but nevertheless can be harmful.
	
	\url{https://www.kevinlondon.com/2015/07/26/dangerous-python-functions.html}
	
	\subsection{Stack-based buffer overflow}
	C is especially susceptible to stack-based buffer overflows. These types of attack rely on no bound-checking, thus allowing an attacker to access a memory address. It usually involves overwriting the memory that was not intended to be accessed, but can also mean reading it, thus revealing sensitive information.
	
	The best-known example of buffer overflow attacks is the Heartbleed bug present in the OpenSSL library. It was exploited in 2014, when hundreds of social insurance numbers were stolen from the Canada Revenue Agency\cite{heartbleed news}.
	
	\subsection{Heap-based buffer overflow}
	Heap-based buffer overflow differs from a stack-based one in that it relies on dynamic memory allocation, and usually aims to corrupt the application's data, as reading or precise overwriting of data is much more difficult than in a stack overflow. 
	
	One of the more severe cases of such an attack was exploiting a bug in Internet Explorer's XML parser in 2014. It allowed for execution of an attacker's code in the browser. It is not the first issue of this kind with Internet Explorer. Another similar one has been discovered in December 2008 in IE7\cite{IE2}.
	
	\subsection{Format string vulnerability}
	In C, printing formatted strings involves format specifiers, for example \texttt{\%s, \%d}. A format string attack occurs when a user-submitted string contains such specifiers. It may allow the attacker to read the content of the stack or perform a denial of service attack.
	
	A notable case of an exploit of this vulnerability occurred in 2000, when hackers gained root access to a host running an FTP daemon\cite{format string}.
